# AIDE Local Runtime

AIDE uses local OpenAI-compatible adapters so model runtimes can be replaced without changing the IDE.

## AIDE Model Pack

- **SmolLM2 360M Instruct Q8_0:** fast chat and planning, about 386 MB.
- **Qwen2.5-Coder 0.5B Instruct Q4_K_M:** fast autocomplete, about 491 MB.
- **Qwen2.5-Coder 1.5B Instruct Q4_K_M:** primary builder, about 1.12 GB.

All three official repositories declare Apache-2.0. The default installer should offer them as optional model packs so users on small devices can choose one. AIDE does not include unfinished project-specific checkpoints in this package.

Run both sequentially on constrained hardware. Do not load two large copies unless memory measurements prove it is safe.

## Qwen Coding Runtime

The official Qwen GGUF repository is Apache-2.0 and provides a Q4_K_M file of approximately 1.12 GB. Use a local llama.cpp-compatible server and bind it to loopback:

```bash
llama-server -hf Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF:Q4_K_M \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8087 --ctx-size 32768
```

For a fully offline run, download the exact GGUF first, verify its SHA-256, then replace `-hf ...` with the local file path.

The current ARM smoke-tested configuration uses the local 1.5B file at `/root/models/qwen2.5-coder-1.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf`, a 4096-token context, four CPU threads, and one parallel slot. It served `/v1/models` and generated a TypeScript function successfully.

For Python DAP, set `AIDE_PYTHON` to the project environment containing `debugpy` when starting the daemon, for example `/path/to/project/.venv/bin/python`.

## AIDE UI

Serve the AIDE root over a local static server so browser `fetch()` can load the manifest:

```bash
python -m http.server 4173 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory /root
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`. The first-run guide checks the selected local adapter and explains Ask, Plan, and Agent modes. It never applies a patch automatically.
